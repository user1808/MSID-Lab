KNN results for the sklearn library oscillate around 0.85. My kNN achieved a score of 0.72. I think this is due to:
1. A way to calculate your nearest neighbors other than Hamming distance.
2. More parameters, such as different weights for neighbors
3. Generally better, more sophisticated and tested code in the library library.
